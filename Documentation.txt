Algorithm Explanation:

>We define a function findPatternOccurrences that takes two parameters: $text (the input text) and $pattern (the pattern to search for).

>We calculate the lengths of the input text and the pattern using strlen.

>We initialize a variable $occurrences to count the number of occurrences of the pattern.

>We use a for loop to iterate through the input text. We start from index 0 and continue until the end of the text minus the length of the pattern.

>In each iteration of the loop, we extract a substring from the input text that has the same length as the pattern, starting from the current position.

>We compare the extracted substring with the pattern. If they match, we increment the $occurrences variable.

>>Finally, we return the total number of occurrences found.
